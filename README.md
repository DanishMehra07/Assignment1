# Assignment1
In Part A of the assignment, trained the simpler form of word embeddings using word2vec.
• In Part B, trained more complex word embeddings using LSTMs and then used them in a text classifier.
• In Part C, implemented different approaches to text classification, including CNNs, and experimented with using word embeddings within those.
• And finally, in Part D, applied all that is done to a real-world text classification task.
